      PRESS RELEASE No 149/25 
      Luxembourg, 2 December 2025 
       
      Judgment of the Court in Case C-34/24 | Stichting Right to Consumer Justice and Stichting App Stores 
      Claims 
      The Netherlands courts have jurisdiction to hear a representative action 
      concerning the alleged anticompetitive conduct of Apple in relation to its 
      App Store aimed at the Netherlands market 
      Apple retains commission from the sale price of third-party apps sold in its App Store. According to two foundations 
      in the Netherlands, which defend the collective interests of multiple unidentified but identifiable users of Apple 
      devices, that commission is excessive and those users suffer damage. Those two foundations argue that Apple’s 
      conduct is anticompetitive and brought actions before the Netherlands courts. Apple, however, contends that the 
      Netherlands court does not have jurisdiction because the alleged harmful event did not, in Apple’s view, occur in the 
      Netherlands and, in particular, in Amsterdam. Having received questions in that context, the Court of Justice states 
      that the App Store in question is designed specially for the Netherlands market. The damage allegedly suffered 
      when purchases are made in that virtual space can therefore occur in that territory, irrespective of the place where 
      the users concerned were situated at the time of the purchase. The Netherlands court therefore has international 
      and territorial jurisdiction. 
      Apple iPhones and iPads run on the iOS operating system, which is pre-installed on those devices. The applications 
      (‘apps’) for those devices can be purchased on the App Store, which is an online platform operated by Apple and is 
      systematically installed on those devices. The App Store offers apps free of charge or in return for payment, which 
      may vary from country to country and which are developed by Apple or by third parties (the latter referred to 
      hereinafter as ‘developers’). In order to sell their apps on the App Store, developers must enter into an agreement 
      with Apple. The sale price for those apps is determined on the basis of a scale established by Apple. In addition, 
      Apple retains, depending on the case, 15 or 30% of that price by way of commission. 
      To access the App Store, users of Apple devices must first create a profile. Where users have an Apple ID indicating 
      the Netherlands as the country or region and they access the App Store, they are directed by default to the ‘online 
      shop’ designed specifically for that country. Although users in theory have the possibility of changing the country 
      associated with their profile, in order to do so, they must accept new terms and conditions and have a valid 
      payment method in that country. 
      Stichting Right to Consumer Justice and Stichting App Stores are foundations governed by Netherlands law whose 
      object is to defend the interests of victims of unlawful conduct on the part of the Apple Group. Those foundations 
      brought two representative actions before the District Court of Amsterdam in order to defend the collective 
      interests of a ‘strictly defined group’ which brings together unidentified but identifiable persons, namely users, 
      whether they are consumers or professionals, who have purchased apps created by the developers on the App 
      Store NL. The applicants argue, inter alia, that Apple abuses its dominant position on the market for the distribution 
      of apps for its devices. That anticompetitive conduct has, in the applicants’ view, caused damage to the users of

      those apps. 
      Apple contends that the Netherlands court does not have jurisdiction to hear this case because the alleged harmful 
      event did not, in Apple’s view, occur in the Netherlands, in particular in Amsterdam. In the alternative, Apple submits 
      that that court can have jurisdiction only in respect of claims concerning users who have made purchases in 
      Amsterdam, in the App Store NL. The Netherlands court decided to refer questions to the Court of Justice regarding 
      1
      the Regulation on jurisdiction.  
      In today’s judgment, the Court recalls its settled case-law, according to which the rule of special jurisdiction laid 
      down in that regulation, which allows the claimant to bring an action before the court for the place where the 
      harmful event occurred or is likely to occur, must be interpreted independently and strictly. This is a derogation 
      from the general rule that the courts where the defendant is domiciled have jurisdiction. 
      In the present case, the App Store in question is designed specially for the Netherlands market and uses Dutch to 
      offer apps for sale to users who have an Apple ID associated with the Netherlands, some of those apps being 
      created specifically for that market. Consequently, in order to determine the place where the damage occurred, the 
      virtual space constituted by the App Store NL, in which the purchases were made, is the entire territory of that State. 
      The damage suffered when those purchases are made can therefore occur in that territory, irrespective of the place 
      where the users concerned were situated at the time of the purchase. 
      In that context, the Court finds that that identification of the place where the damage occurred, in order to 
      determine the court having jurisdiction, meets the objectives of proximity, predictability of the rules governing 
      jurisdiction, and the sound administration of justice. In particular, since the App Store NL targets the Netherlands 
      market specifically, it is predictable that an action for damages in respect of purchases made on that platform will 
      be brought before any Netherlands court that has substantive jurisdiction to hear such an action in respect of all the 
      users who have purchases digital products on that platform. 
      NOTE: A reference for a preliminary ruling allows the courts and tribunals of the Member States, in disputes which 
      have been brought before them, to refer questions to the Court of Justice about the interpretation of European 
      Union law or the validity of a European Union act. The Court of Justice does not decide the dispute itself. It is for the 
      national court or tribunal to dispose of the case in accordance with the Court’s decision, which is similarly binding on 
      other national courts or tribunals before which a similar issue is raised.
